#Summary
My favorite things include W3C specs, interface design, science fiction, and earl grey tea. Currently, my go-to stack for web application projects includes Angular 2, Node.js, Redux, and Sass. I'm primarily a JavaScript developer, though I got my start programming in C and have explored a plethora of languages in between.
