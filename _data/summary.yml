#Summary
I'm a designer and developer currently working on a virtual machine orchestration system at F5 Networks. I am dedicated to my work; always aiming to find the optimal solution, and willing to put in extra time to meet a deadline if necessary. In my spare time I build web apps, read science fiction, and work on my tea collection. With all the emerging W3C specs and the liveliness of the JavaScript community, I'm really excited about the future of web applications.
